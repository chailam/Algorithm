# Algorithm and Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented during my university studies. It encompasses various sorting algorithms, dynamic programming solutions, searching algorithms, shortest path algorithms, and essential data structures. Additionally, it includes some smaller tasks completed as assignments.

#### 1. Data Structures

- Binary Search Tree

- Hash Table   
Implemented with three collision resolution techniques:
   - Linear Probing
   - Quadratic Probing
   - Separate Chaining

- Linked List   
A linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.

- Linked Stack   
A stack data structure implemented using a linked list.

- Heap   
A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

- Tree   
A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node containing a value and references to child nodes.

- Trie   
A tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings, where keys are usually strings.

- List   
A collection of elements that can be accessed by index.

### 2. Dynamic Programming

Solving the knapsack problem where each item can either be included or excluded.

- Unbounded Knapsack Problem   
A variation of the knapsack problem where items can be included multiple times.

- Fibonacci   
Computing Fibonacci numbers efficiently using dynamic programming.

- Edit Distance   
Calculating the minimum number of edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

- Coin Change Problem   
Finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount of money.

- Longest Increasing Subsequence   
Finding the longest subsequence of a given sequence where the subsequence's elements are in sorted order.

- Playlist Searching   
Using dynamic programming to efficiently search within playlists.

- Travelling Salesman   
Solving the Travelling Salesman Problem using dynamic programming techniques.

### 3. Searching Algorithms

- Binary Search   
An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.

- DFS and A*/A Algorithm   
Depth-First Search and A* Search algorithms for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. This implementation is part of the Machine Learning AI repository, available [here](https://github.com/chailam/Machine-Learning-AI/blob/main/Depth%20Limited%20Search%20(DLS)%20%26%20A%20Search/graphSearch.py).
